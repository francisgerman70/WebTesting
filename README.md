- The webpage contains a search button (the magnifying glass in the upper right)
- When the button is pressed, the search bar appears.
- When the letters csc are typed in that search bar, they appear correctly.
- When the search for csc is launched (either by clicking the search button at the end of
the search bar, or by sending Keys.ENTER, a new webpage loads with Search –
University of Victoria as its title.
- When you load uvic.ca, somewhere on that page, the phone number 1-250-721-7211
appears. Note that it is not enough to find the link – your test must confirm that the phone number is 1-250-721-7211.
